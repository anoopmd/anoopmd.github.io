title: Take a break when you are stuck
---

It is very important to take a break when you are really stuck at something.

To me, many times I have seen myself hooked to a problem for endless hours trying to 
figure out the solution. My head gets clogged and I subconsciously start fire fighting 
without looking into the details of the problem. Then finally when I am beyond my saturation
point, I give up. Next day, I come back, and voila, I solve the problem in 15 min.

In my opinion, when we are hooked into a problem, our brain sometimes gets tired, and 
we cannoyt think clearly. Taking a break gives your mind and helps you to 
see the solution.
