Just buy the sandwich.

In their first session, Wald’s coach asked about his personal and professional goals. It was a simple question, but Wald found himself without an answer. “I looked at him and said, ‘I don't know. I don't have any,’’ Wald says. “He packed up his stuff and said, ‘I’ll be back next week. You have homework. My job is to help you be effective at achieving your goals. And if you don’t come up with them, I can’t do my job. You need to think about what your goals are.’”

For Wald, that goal-focused framework was an incredibly simple, but clarifying and impactful tool. “I now apply that mindset to everything that I do. Take even a silly example, such as when you’re trying to order lunch and the person behind the counter isn’t paying attention. You get frustrated and think, ‘What the heck?’ But then you remember that your goal is not to fix this company’s operations or make this person a better sales representative. Your goal is just to buy the sandwich,” he says.

Whether it’s ordering a sandwich at a deli or leading a project at work, staying focused on your goals — on what’s important — is key to getting out of your own way.
