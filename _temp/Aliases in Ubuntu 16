Aliases in Ubuntu 16

One of the most common commands that I use is git status and git diff.
It would be nice to have aliases for them like gs and gd
Lets add the aliases then.

## You must have this in your ~/.bashrc file


```bash
# Alias definitions.
# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like
# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.
# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.

if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.bash_aliases
fi
```

## Lets create a file ~/.bash_aliases
```bash
alias gs='git status';
alias gd='git diff';
```

## Source your bash script
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
