title: I Damn Hate AngularJS
---
(In the interest of Decency, I have used the word Damn. Feel free to replace it with F***)

I am pissed off with AngularJS.<br>
I am damn pissed of with Angular JS.

Programming is my passion. And an obesession.

<b>But I am damn pissed of with AngularJS.</b><br>

In my 4 years of programming career, I have written tons of C.<br>
Lots of JS (Node.js and BackboneJS) and a fair amount of PHP.<br>
(And more than a thousand unit tests. I am big advocate of UTs)

In any language, or app, I penetrate and go down the stack as much as I can.<br>
For the Love of it, I have written sniffer programs in C to sniff Ethernet packets (Layer 2 OSI Model)<br>
For the Love of it, I have written programs in C that construct the IPv4 Packets (Layer 3 OSI Model)<br>
In my company I was junior member in the Team which was implementing the 4G Stack. (Completely written in C)

In my college days, When my peers where trying to program microcontrollers,<br>
I was busy working on transistors. I was constructing circuits using transistors.<br>
I was fascinated with 555 Timer. I built a 7SegDisplay Counter which counts from 1 to 100 just using NAND gates (IC7400) and NOR Gates (IC7402)

I am currently practising and solving problems in Mathematics on Number Theory, So that I can understand Https protocol, Public Key Cryptography in its entirety.
I plan to learn the plumbing tools in Git.

<b>What is the point that I am trying to make here?</b><br>
I am the type of programmer who is obsessed with clarity and depth.<br>
In C, I can understand a program which uses a pointer to pointer to pointer (May be up to 10 levels)<br> 

<b>My Journey with Angular JS</b><br>
Its been 3-4 Months since I have started using it.After putting some effort, I was able to get a simple CRUD app running. Use ng-repeat, ng-show and so on. That was easy and fun.

I am currently working on medium scale angular app.<br>
These are written by US Programmers. I am a big admirer of US Programmers.

But when the app gets complex, and it is written by programmers who put quality first, For someone like me, you start feeling the frustration of programming in AngularJS.

As of now, I am having a hard time modifying a directive.(datepicker-popup to be specific).<br>
I hate declarative languages. No, No, No, No.... I like SQL.<br>
The truth is I hate specifically AngularJS.

<b>Abstractions</b><br>
I am a big advocate of abstractions.<br>
International Space Station is one of the biggest examples of this.<br>
Built by 15 countries, Components taken to space and it works.<br>

C Language gives a Nice abstraction to Assembly Language.<br>
I like PHP, Java, Node.js too. These higher level languages also give a good abstraction.<br>
The abstraction provided all the above mentioned languages/tools are neat and good.<br>

But Not AngularJS.<br>
I feel, I can ready assembly language more easily than AngularJS code.<br>

<b> Language syntax</b><br>
In all the previous languages/framworks that I have worked on, the syntax is very natural.<br>
Assembly: MOV, ADD, SUB, INC, DEC, GOTO<br>
C: Pointers, Integers, Functions, Structures<br>
Backbone: Models, Collection, Views, Router, Events, initialize()<br>
Node JS: http.createServer(), Buffer, Queue, Stream<br>
Javascript: Promises, Events, Objects, Event Loop<br>
PHP and JAVA: Classes, Object, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Interface, abstract, static, final, implements.

In the above languages, the names used are very much the language that we can closely relate to and easily understand. It comes naturally to you.<br>

<b>
But then I have AngularJS.<br>
Providers, Factories, Services (All these are closely linked), And Directives <br>
Damn. Damn. Damn.
</b><br>

I just have to type some jargon in html and hope it works. Damn.<br>
(I am not talking about ng-model OR ng-repeat, I am talking about complex directives)<br>
I hate magic which annoys and pisses me.

I love the magic of Docker, I love the magic of Vagrant, I love the magic of V8.<br>
<b>But I hate the magic of AngularJS.</b>

I am sure that the guys who built AngularJS are really really smart.<br>
They build an awesome framework which is best for Rapid App Prototyping and Development.
They also suit the need of Enterprise, Rich UI apps.<br>
In my opinion, Its just that their taste in developing the api syntax is bad.

But I am at least relieved that, at the end, it is Javascript.<br>
That If I put all my energy, I will be able to understand in its entirety.

Being a JS dev, And looking forward to the <b>next 5 years</b> in becoming a JS Hardcore Pro.
I am left with no option other than to conquer AngularJS. To spend endless hours reading through the source code to understand the magic behind it.

My company trusts me. My leads trust me. I cannot let them or myself down.
Thay have entrusted me with maintaining AngularJS projects.

I cannot fathom the thought of me typing something and hoping it works.<br>
I cannot damn fathom that.

In all my previous years, I used to go home and sleep with a satisfaction.<br>
Because everyday I used to understand a little bit more. Learn a little bit more.<br>
And more importantly, I enjoyed programming in them.<br>
Such is the beauty of C, Javascript, PHP, Node.js and even Assembly.

But Now, I have sleepless nights.

<b>To conclude.</b>

I am putting solving Math and Number theory on hold.<br>
I am putting playing with Docker on Hold<br>
I am diving into Node.js source on Hold.

I am going for AngularJS. I am going to ready possibly every line in its source.<br>
I am going to F***ing master the inner workings of it.
Beacuse, without that, I will go insane.

And I cannot confidently talk or have a discssuion with my angular peers if I dont understand the magic behind it.

As WWE Ex Pro Wrestler Goldberg Says.

AngularJS. You're Next.
